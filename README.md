YNAB Enhanced
=============

YNAB Enhanced is a general purpose YNAB enhancing chrome extension. Have it your way!

YNAB have released an exciting new web version. Lots of power users of the older
versions are asking for options that are easily implemented in a browser extension.
Rather than ask the YNAB team to implement these features, let's just do it
ourselves!

You can do 3 things at the moment with this:

- Colour Blind Mode - Changes colours of some of the numbers to make the interface easier on people with certain visual disabilities.
- Make the calculator work like YNAB4. When you press + or - (etc) the calculator moves to the end of the line so your number isn't lost.
- Hide the Age of Money calculation.

All of these are configurable with options in the extension options page.

This is early days, but I'm excited!

Next Up in Priorities & Features Under Consideration
